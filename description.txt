Master Hand adds the Master Hand as a usable item. Has a 1% drop rate from Skeletron's Hands after the Moon Lord is defeated.
If you hold an NPC for too long it will probably dissapear.

Works in multiplayer but is kinda woncky with players. Being dead and grabbing things will result in them achieving MACH-10 instantly.

Credits to "EXEcutor-The-Bat" for the Master-Hand sprites.
